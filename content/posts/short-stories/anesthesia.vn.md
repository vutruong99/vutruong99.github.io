Do you know what’s scary? Anesthesia.
<!--more-->

When I was 20, I was put under for my wisdom teeth removal operation. A few weeks later I had to remove another 4 teeth to prepare for my bracing procedure. I know, I was quite old for braces. The dentist injected anesthetics into my gums.

If you look at anesthesia from a medical perspective, there is nothing to be afraid of. There are three types of anesthesia: Local, regional, and general. Local anesthesia numbs a small area of your body; you are conscious. Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals from a bigger part of your body, like arms or legs, from traveling to your brain; you are still conscious. General anesthesia puts you under; you will not feel or remember anything. In the old days, the main component of anesthetics was Diethyl Ether. After that, Nitrous Oxide (the laughing gas) and other derivatives of Ether (Isoflurane, Sevoflurane, and Desflurane) are more commonly used.

So why is it scary though? I watched a movie called Awake about a guy who underwent  heart surgery. He had General anesthesia; he was unable to move but was fully conscious and alert of the surroundings. I was scarred for life. Imagine knowing that a person is messing with your heart, imagine feeling every bit of the pain, but not being able to move, to cry, to scream. There was a girl who gave me that experience once.

What else makes it scary? During one local anesthesia, I was fully aware of the fact the dentist was pulling my teeth out, yet there was no pain. It was truly unnerving. At that moment my pain receptors were confused, they know that they should be receiving electrical impulses from that area, but got none. Therefore, my brain stimulated its own pain signals. I actually created the fake pain inside my mind. Afterward, the knowledge of the fact that the numbness was about to wear off, that the real pain would come any second now, was disturbing. I knew that the pain was there, it had always been there, and I was waiting slowly for the numbness to disappear, for the pain. When it arrived, I wasn’t sure if I was ready. It damaged me gradually. It hurt me. I wanted to stick your fingers in that bloody flesh and pull the pain out. But I couldn’t.

Perhaps every day, we all produce our own mental anesthetics. We block a certain dreadful memory from the past. We divert the sorrow with recreational activities. We numb our mind, tricking it not to think about that one time we screwed up and lost our chance of being loved. We choose to forget an event, to ignore a person. In the end, we are all very afraid of the moment our anesthetics wear off, when the pain rushes in. We are all very afraid of facing the truth.

Anesthesia isn’t scary, what comes after is.
